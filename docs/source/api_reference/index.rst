API Reference
=============

This section of the |PackageNameStylized| documentation details all available
classes, methods, and other objects available through the package.

The |PackageNameStylized| package is organized into a number of submodules
(:py:mod:`pyxx.units`, :py:mod:`pyxx.strings`, etc.), grouped based on similar
functionality.  Each section of the API reference will detail a single
submodule.  It is recommended that you first look at the submodule-level
pages, as they contain tables organizing the objects available within the
submodule.
